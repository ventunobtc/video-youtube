[00:00:01.680] 
In the winter of 2009, a piece of software was released on the internet.

[00:00:05.640] 
Digital money called bitcoin.

[00:00:09.000] 
Like throwing water on burning oil, it ignited.

[00:00:12.440] 
And this is the biggest story of this decade.

[00:00:15.880] 
Bitcoin sent shockwaves through the world,

[00:00:18.440] 
spreading like wildfire and disrupting everything it touched.

[00:00:22.320] 
Nobody knew what it was,

[00:00:23.560] 
nobody knew how to value it, and and nobody could control it.

[00:00:26.800] 
And like any new technology, it came with pushback.

[00:00:29.720] 
The whole bitcoin market is about a billion dollars.

[00:00:31.760] 
It's a novelty for the geek squad.

[00:00:33.600] 
On top of all of these attacks, critics came after its energy usage.

[00:00:37.640] 
That's right. Bitcoin consumes energy.

[00:00:40.720] 
Bitcoin in general is wasteful by design.

[00:00:43.720] 
Bitcoin uses a system called proof of work, which requires energy to function.

[00:00:48.600] 
Bitcoin uses more energy than countries

[00:00:50.760] 
like Ukraine, Norway, Sweden, argentina or the Philippines.

[00:00:55.600] 
Now, if you just heard of those comparisons, you're likely shocked.

[00:00:59.040] 
And here's where proof of stake comes in.

[00:01:01.480] 
I think great things are on the other side.

[00:01:03.440] 
So number one is obviously proof of stake

[00:01:06.480] 
so much more efficient, much more secure, much less tree killing.

[00:01:13.080] 
Thousands of new cryptocurrencies use this new proof of stake model,

[00:01:16.920] 
all promising to be superior to the old energy intensive proof of work technology.

[00:01:22.640] 
There's only one problem.

[00:01:24.320] 
Is this true, or are they marketing false promises?

[00:01:27.640] 
One of my issues with sort of proof of stake, the way it's been presented

[00:01:30.760] 
and with the ethereum roadmap, is that I think that the risks are not

[00:01:34.040] 
sort of fully discussed in a very open, intellectually honest way.

[00:01:37.280] 
From this video,

[00:01:38.240] 
we will see the differences between proof of work and proof of stake,

[00:01:42.000] 
the problems tied to each, and whether one is more efficient than the other.

[00:01:46.400] 
Often the advantages of proof of stake are

[00:01:48.720] 
described without acknowledgement of its trade offs compared to proof of work.

[00:01:52.640] 
To understand these trade offs, we must first break down what proof of work is.

[00:01:57.680] 
The bitcoin network is programmed

[00:01:59.440] 
to create a new block every ten minutes and add that block to the blockchain.

[00:02:04.320] 
A new block is produced by a bitcoin miner, contributing processing power

[00:02:08.400] 
to solve a cryptographic puzzle that the previous block created.

[00:02:12.120] 
At this point, the miner can package

[00:02:14.160] 
thousands of bitcoin transactions into that block.

[00:02:17.080] 
That's how transactions get settled.

[00:02:19.240] 
The YouTube channel three blue one brown explains the other half of proof of work.

[00:02:23.360] 
In this short clip earlier, I said.

[00:02:25.720] 
That the proof of work might be to find

[00:02:27.240] 
a special number so that the hash of the block starts with 60 zeros.

[00:02:31.600] 
Well, the way the actual bitcoin protocol

[00:02:33.560] 
works is to periodically change that number of zeroes so that it should

[00:02:37.520] 
take, on average, ten minutes to find a new block.

[00:02:41.120] 
So as there are more and more miners added

[00:02:43.520] 
to the network, the challenge actually gets harder and harder in such a way

[00:02:47.440] 
that this miniature lottery only has about one winner every ten minutes.

[00:02:51.800] 
What three blue, one brown just described is known as the difficulty adjustment,

[00:02:56.120] 
which occurs automatically every two weeks.

[00:02:59.040] 
This difficulty adjustment ensures the supply of bitcoin remains limited.

[00:03:03.440] 
Value investor and podcast host

[00:03:05.360] 
Preston Pitch explains why a difficult supply issuance is important for bitcoin.

[00:03:11.040] 
When I think about what worked historically before we even went

[00:03:15.240] 
into a digital space, the reason gold works so well is because

[00:03:19.080] 
it's really kind of hard to find an ounce of it in the earth's crust because it's

[00:03:24.000] 
distribution of it and whatnot the amount that there is.

[00:03:27.800] 
So when you look at why gold served

[00:03:30.480] 
the purpose, it's very obvious from a scarcity standpoint why.

[00:03:34.120] 
And then you look at the work that had

[00:03:36.160] 
to be performed with a shovel or whatever in order to pull it out of the ground,

[00:03:41.480] 
it makes sense real fast as to how it basically achieved its value.

[00:03:46.600] 
Just like gold mining,

[00:03:47.920] 
bitcoin miners put forward work or energy in order to mine new bitcoin.

[00:03:52.440] 
And just like people value gold due to its

[00:03:54.560] 
rarity, people value bitcoin because it's scarce and difficult to find.

[00:03:59.440] 
This process is known as proof of work.

[00:04:02.040] 
Millions of machines use electricity to apply processing power to guess

[00:04:06.600] 
the answer to a cryptographic puzzle left by the most recent block.

[00:04:11.080] 
This may seem like a waste of energy, but it's what keeps the system decentralized.

[00:04:15.640] 
No central authority determines a valid set of transactions.

[00:04:19.920] 
The more energy that bitcoin uses,

[00:04:22.240] 
the more secure its latest transactions are against most types of attacks.

[00:04:26.920] 
Many nonbitcoin blockchains have been

[00:04:28.960] 
victims of 51% attacks where a single entity temporarily or permanently gains

[00:04:34.480] 
control over 51% of the processing power on the network and uses that majority

[00:04:40.000] 
of processing power to reorganize blocks and perform double spend transactions.

[00:04:45.880] 
This shows bitcoin's energy usage compared

[00:04:48.160] 
to the energy usage of some of the copycat networks.

[00:04:51.480] 
Those other blockchains only have 1% or less of bitcoin's total processing power.

[00:04:56.920] 
So if just 1% of bitcoin miners decide

[00:05:00.000] 
to do a 51% attack on either of those two hard forks, they can.

[00:05:04.680] 
However, the same is not true for the other direction.

[00:05:07.440] 
Since the bitcoin network uses far more energy, that shows the importance

[00:05:11.640] 
of network effects and why bitcoin's energy usage has kept it secure.

[00:05:15.960] 
Bitcoin's energy usage can also benefit our global power grids.

[00:05:19.920] 
As macro investor Lynn Alden explains, I.

[00:05:23.280] 
Think actually when we look out longer term, the kind of the direction that we're

[00:05:26.160] 
going, I think in proof of work, assuming these systems continue to be

[00:05:29.640] 
around for quite a while, is that you'll see increasing integration

[00:05:33.440] 
between miners and the energy producers themselves.

[00:05:37.080] 
We already see, for example,

[00:05:38.640] 
early signs of colocation where you have an energy producer could be solar,

[00:05:44.360] 
could be hydro, could be whatever, and they have bitcoin miners on site.

[00:05:48.680] 
They often will contract with a miner

[00:05:50.840] 
to colocate them, but they could easily do it in a vertically integrated model where

[00:05:55.480] 
the way that the grid works and this is something that a lot of kind

[00:05:57.840] 
of environmental criticisms of proof of work don't understand is

[00:06:01.760] 
that the electrical grid naturally has to overproduce electricity.

[00:06:05.680] 
Otherwise if we didn't have extra productive capacity then turning

[00:06:09.760] 
on the marginal laptop would cause a brownout, right?

[00:06:12.320] 
So we have to have this spare production

[00:06:15.440] 
always going into the network and then we have to have a way to drain out excess

[00:06:19.920] 
power that's being produced but not consumed.

[00:06:21.960] 
And it's actually this really kind of tricky balancing act.

[00:06:24.800] 
And so proof of work systems are actually

[00:06:26.920] 
a really good load balancer where if you're the type of energy source

[00:06:31.200] 
that doesn't have full control over your production, maybe you're a wind farm,

[00:06:35.400] 
maybe you're a hydro dam, maybe you're solar.

[00:06:37.480] 
Or maybe you have just kind of your

[00:06:39.640] 
nuclear plant that just kind of has continuous power.

[00:06:42.200] 
But maybe the demand is fluctuating throughout the day, right?

[00:06:45.480] 
So it's more demand at evening, less demand other times.

[00:06:50.120] 
And so I think over time we're going to see that the cheapest source

[00:06:53.840] 
of electricity is that virtually zero cost stranded energy.

[00:06:58.400] 
And the best ones to harness that are the producers or people that contract

[00:07:03.240] 
directly with the producers and go on site.

[00:07:05.520] 
And so I think over time that's what

[00:07:08.400] 
basically makes it as kind of diversified as possible.

[00:07:10.880] 
And right now I think last I checked,

[00:07:13.240] 
the biggest bitcoin mining facility in the world is like 1% of total hash rate.

[00:07:16.960] 
It's already kind of a structurally decentralized system and I think it only

[00:07:21.160] 
gets more so as you increasingly incorporate that into production.

[00:07:25.080] 
Since its inception the bitcoin network

[00:07:27.280] 
has operated using proof of work with no plans to change.

[00:07:31.080] 
The theorem network also operates

[00:07:33.200] 
with proof of work but it has future plans to switch to a proof of stake system.

[00:07:37.880] 
But what is proof of stake?

[00:07:40.240] 
Proof of stake is a system where

[00:07:42.120] 
cryptocurrency holders stake their coins, use them to vote on the valid blockchain

[00:07:47.080] 
and get rewarded with more coins for successfully creating new blocks.

[00:07:51.120] 
So instead of committing electricity

[00:07:53.000] 
to create new blocks, they're committing their stake of coins.

[00:07:56.680] 
Proof of work is simple because there's no need to punish bad miners that try

[00:08:01.040] 
to validate the wrong blocks that don't fit to the rules of the node network.

[00:08:05.200] 
Their punishment is that they spent electricity on blocks that weren't valid

[00:08:09.360] 
thus losing money they self inflict their own wound so it rarely happens.

[00:08:14.840] 
Proof of stake is more complex because

[00:08:17.080] 
there is no connection to real world resources.

[00:08:19.960] 
Without a connection to real world

[00:08:21.720] 
resources like energy, stakers can attack the blockchain without any punishment.

[00:08:27.280] 
Proof of stake works around this problem

[00:08:29.360] 
by taking away Staker's coins if they vote improperly.

[00:08:32.720] 
This solution comes with a few tradeoffs, one being complexity.

[00:08:36.960] 
An ethereum developer recently described

[00:08:39.440] 
the complexity issues facing their proof of stake system.

[00:08:42.720] 
In Ethereum's history, complexity never decreased.

[00:08:45.840] 
Every EIP is piling on top.

[00:08:48.120] 
Every major change is one more nail.

[00:08:50.440] 
I'm extremely frustrated when a research proposal says everything's figured out.

[00:08:54.840] 
It's just engineering.

[00:08:56.120] 
Now, I must emphasize that Ethereum is not going in a clean direction.

[00:09:00.520] 
Tangentially is achieving results,

[00:09:02.640] 
but it's also piling complexity like there's no tomorrow.

[00:09:05.880] 
If the protocol doesn't get slimmer, it's not going to make it.

[00:09:09.040] 
We are already past the point of anyone having a full picture of the system.

[00:09:13.680] 
This is bad.

[00:09:14.920] 
I can't say what the solution is, but my two cent is to stop adding features

[00:09:19.640] 
and start calling, even at the expense of breaking things.

[00:09:23.400] 
There are less and less people knowing

[00:09:25.320] 
and willing to piece together a broken network, and each change pushes more away.

[00:09:30.440] 
The last sentence should be taken seriously.

[00:09:33.280] 
A lead developer of Ethereum basically

[00:09:35.560] 
said, if the protocol continues to get more complex, less and less developers

[00:09:40.400] 
will be able to grasp its complexity, putting the system at risk.

[00:09:40.645] 
Samson Mao, a developer in the Bitcoin

[00:09:42.885] 
ecosystem, describes this complexity issue from another perspective.

[00:09:47.165] 
There's a lot of problems with proof of stake, why it cannot work,

[00:09:50.925] 
and if you fix one of the problems, you create another problem.

[00:09:54.285] 
So the general trend is for proofofstake proponents to create a very,

[00:09:59.085] 
very complex system so that the flaws cannot be easily identified.

[00:10:03.485] 
So proof of stake is a more more complex

[00:10:05.765] 
system that will take away Staker's coins if they vote improperly and has ways

[00:10:10.485] 
of checking to see if they are voting on multiple chains.

[00:10:13.885] 
Another developer for Ethereum,

[00:10:15.765] 
Ben Edgington, explains the long term challenges that Ethereum has faced as it

[00:10:20.685] 
undergoes its multiyear shift from proof of work towards proof of stake.

[00:10:25.645] 
The reason it's taken a while we've relied on proof of work in Ethereum for five plus

[00:10:31.245] 
years is that proof of stake is complicated.

[00:10:34.965] 
Proof of work is fundamentally very simple.

[00:10:37.325] 
It's easy to analyze, it's easy to implement and deploy.

[00:10:41.045] 
And proof of stake has a lot of moving parts.

[00:10:44.925] 
You can code up a proof of work algorithm in 100 lines or so.

[00:10:48.965] 
Our current clients are 100,000 lines of proof of stake.

[00:10:54.085] 
And I think the theoretical foundations

[00:10:57.525] 
for proof of stake have taken time to mature.

[00:11:00.885] 
It's not obvious how to make it robust.

[00:11:03.765] 
There are attacks, like long range attacks and things which just don't exist in proof

[00:11:08.605] 
of work that we've had to think through and come up with solutions to.

[00:11:12.925] 
So that's just taken time.

[00:11:14.525] 
So meanwhile, we've relied on the tried

[00:11:16.285] 
and tested proof of work algorithm and it served Ethereum well.

[00:11:20.165] 
Besides this larger complexity, trust and attack surfaces.

[00:11:24.005] 
Another risk with proof of stake is centralization.

[00:11:27.285] 
With a proof of stake system,

[00:11:28.805] 
the more coins you have, the more voting power you have.

[00:11:32.125] 
And those with the coins are also the ones earning the new coins from staking.

[00:11:36.485] 
Since they don't need to expend resources to stake, they can increase their overall

[00:11:40.885] 
staking amount by earning ongoing coins from staking rewards.

[00:11:44.925] 
So basically, that would be like a political system

[00:11:47.405] 
where the more money you have, the more power you have.

[00:11:49.965] 
In addition, for every $100 you have

[00:11:52.485] 
to vote, you would get paid one dollars from the government for voting.

[00:11:57.165] 
So let's say there's a high school teacher with $20,000 in net worth.

[00:12:01.765] 
If she voted with all that money,

[00:12:03.525] 
she would get $200 from the government for voting.

[00:12:06.285] 
Whereas if you had somebody like

[00:12:07.645] 
Jeff Bezos with $200 billion in net worth, if he voted with all that money,

[00:12:12.725] 
he would get $2 billion from the government for voting.

[00:12:16.125] 
So by a factor of a million, jeff Bezos would be a more valuable

[00:12:20.365] 
citizen than the high school teacher and he would get paid a factor

[00:12:25.285] 
of a million more by the system for already being wealthy.

[00:12:29.525] 
Eventually, power would likely consolidate with a handful of multibillionaires,

[00:12:34.325] 
controlling most votes and rolling everything if it gets too centralized.

[00:12:38.525] 
That kind of defeats the purpose of a decentralized blockchain.

[00:12:42.205] 
Instead. That proof of stake system mainly works

[00:12:45.045] 
well for stakes in centralized private property like corporations.

[00:12:49.485] 
In a corporation,

[00:12:50.765] 
each share is worth a vote for proposals and board seats, since the owners decide

[00:12:55.605] 
what the company will do in proportion to their ownership.

[00:12:58.925] 
So suppose they are more like a corporation.

[00:13:02.005] 
In that case, the proof of stake model

[00:13:04.045] 
isn't bad for cryptocurrencies to use for experimentation.

[00:13:07.645] 
In fact, proof of stake can increase the cost of attacking the protocol,

[00:13:11.765] 
since attackers would need to acquire a lot of the coins.

[00:13:15.165] 
But of course they'll be prone to centralization.

[00:13:17.965] 
But that can be okay if there's competition.

[00:13:20.565] 
If their service isn't good, people can go elsewhere.

[00:13:23.605] 
The creator of proof of work, Adam Back, describes why he thinks proof of work

[00:13:28.405] 
outperforms proof of stake when trying to be a money like asset.

[00:13:32.965] 
It's a system that works because money has a cost.

[00:13:36.445] 
I think money that doesn't have a cost

[00:13:38.405] 
ultimately ends up being political in nature.

[00:13:41.165] 
So people closer to the money,

[00:13:43.125] 
so called cancel in effect, are going to be advantaged.

[00:13:47.085] 
People with the post strings to create more money have enormous political power.

[00:13:51.405] 
Lin Alden also takes a similar stance to Adam Back saying why she thinks proof

[00:13:56.565] 
of stake mimics stock like assets more than monetary assets.

[00:14:00.965] 
Right. So if we're talking about what makes

[00:14:02.605] 
a good money, it's something that is inherently simple and inherently small.

[00:14:07.285] 
No decentralized proof of work basically

[00:14:09.245] 
the leanest code you can get and distributed among as many machines as

[00:14:13.005] 
you can get and as immutable as you can get.

[00:14:15.405] 
Whereas as we layer things on top of it,

[00:14:17.845] 
like proof of stake adds a lot of code complexity.

[00:14:20.285] 
It also makes it, use my prior example, more like volatile memory than non.

[00:14:24.685] 
Volatile memory needs to be continuously lies in order to function as intended.

[00:14:29.405] 
And so when you layer those things on top of it, I would say that takes away

[00:14:33.765] 
a monetary premium and you can argue that it adds equity value.

[00:14:37.925] 
Right. So for example, when we look at Apple

[00:14:40.125] 
stock, right, so we look at Apple stock over the long term,

[00:14:44.765] 
like this kind of meme of ultrasound money for ethereum.

[00:14:48.245] 
You have this thing where it's mostly

[00:14:49.805] 
focused on whether it's inflating or deflating and what percentage.

[00:14:53.885] 
Right? So for example, Apple stock is actually

[00:14:56.045] 
one of the most deflationary assets around.

[00:14:58.325] 
It's got a 4.5% average annual deflation rate.

[00:15:01.885] 
Over the past ten years,

[00:15:02.885] 
they decreased their share count from 26 million to 16 million.

[00:15:06.005] 
And that's of course one of the factors

[00:15:07.525] 
for why they did well on a per share basis.

[00:15:09.765] 
But at the end of the day, when it comes down to because they're

[00:15:13.405] 
in equity, it's the attractiveness of their ecosystem for customers, right?

[00:15:17.365] 
So it's not about how many shares they have, because you have other ones like

[00:15:20.445] 
IBM, that are also rapidly reducing their share count, but because their ecosystems

[00:15:25.365] 
unhealthy, they're not really crewing that value to shares overall.

[00:15:29.405] 
And so I think when it comes down to kind of what is trying to be money,

[00:15:33.885] 
the thing that does almost nothing other than just be money is the best money.

[00:15:38.245] 
And something that tries to do multiple things, including proof of stake as one

[00:15:42.165] 
of the components, inherently gives it less monetary premium.

[00:15:45.925] 
In a proof of work system,

[00:15:47.605] 
power is distributed between miners, developers, and individual nodes.

[00:15:52.325] 
Your ability to be a minor is based

[00:15:54.405] 
on your ability to put forth money and find low cost electricity.

[00:15:58.725] 
Rather than the original miners having an advantage and increasing their

[00:16:02.565] 
advantage over time, new miners have a technical advantage over

[00:16:06.165] 
existing miners because they buy newer machines with more processing power.

[00:16:11.165] 
If you bought a mining rig four years ago and I bought one, right now,

[00:16:15.365] 
I have a bigger advantage, or I can capture more coins.

[00:16:19.805] 
That's rare.

[00:16:21.165] 
That new entrant has an advantage over the old entrant, right?

[00:16:27.005] 
So, like you came into it four years ago,

[00:16:29.085] 
it's harder for you to capture and mine the coins than it is for me.

[00:16:32.605] 
And I think that what that does.

[00:16:34.605] 
And when you look at proof of stake, it's a little bit different.

[00:16:37.685] 
If you had first access to the coins,

[00:16:39.605] 
you now have an advantage over somebody who's now just coming in that's trying

[00:16:43.885] 
to capture them and employ them into the network.

[00:16:47.525] 
And so from this system, bitcoin mining businesses, old and new,

[00:16:51.965] 
are all in constant competition with each other.

[00:16:54.925] 
This is opposite to proof of stake, where there is no competition.

[00:16:59.165] 
Once you have ownership of the tokens,

[00:17:01.605] 
you can keep that power in the system forever.

[00:17:04.565] 
Plus, bitcoin developers went to great lengths to make it easy and cheap to run

[00:17:09.405] 
a full node, which allows any user to audit the entire blockchain and reject

[00:17:14.205] 
blocks that don't conform with the rules of the network.

[00:17:17.645] 
As a result, the real power rests with the nodes rather than the miners.

[00:17:22.125] 
If miners try to collude and mine invalid

[00:17:24.885] 
blocks, the node network simply rejects those blocks.

[00:17:28.565] 
So the system is similar to the US.

[00:17:30.645] 
Constitution, where it has three branches of government.

[00:17:33.365] 
You would have the executive branch,

[00:17:34.885] 
the legislative branch, and the judicial branch.

[00:17:37.605] 
These branches would have the ability to overrule each other in certain contexts.

[00:17:43.165] 
And in addition to this overruling, they would have staggered term limits.

[00:17:47.165] 
So this is by design.

[00:17:49.885] 
You wouldn't want political people to have power forever.

[00:17:52.805] 
You would want to vote them out of office in favor of newer people with new ideas.

[00:17:57.405] 
And this is how the US. Works.

[00:17:59.685] 
So, like the United States,

[00:18:01.445] 
the bitcoin network has three branches that limit each other's power.

[00:18:05.645] 
The node network has the final say over

[00:18:07.965] 
consensus, but relies on miners to order transactions and developers to create new

[00:18:13.525] 
updates that both the miners and the node network accept.

[00:18:17.045] 
Many other blockchains make multiple trade

[00:18:19.285] 
offs, including making the nodes require immense processing power,

[00:18:23.205] 
bandwidth and storage so that only large entities can run them,

[00:18:27.485] 
which centralizes the network into a handful of major providers.

[00:18:32.285] 
The point I want to make here is that this is also slippery slope, right?

[00:18:34.685] 
Yeah, of course. Like increasing the requirements by 10%,

[00:18:37.605] 
maybe ethereum increases by 10% a year can have an outsize effect where suddenly 90%

[00:18:42.805] 
of the people who would have done this can no longer do it.

[00:18:45.085] 
Right. So it's it's not linear.

[00:18:46.365] 
Yeah. And once you start going down that path,

[00:18:48.365] 
right, the reasonable central free slope is you're like, well, you know,

[00:18:52.045] 
it's already hard, so it's not a big deal if we make it a little bit harder.

[00:18:54.725] 
And this is why the thought of, like,

[00:18:56.485] 
increasing the bitcoin block size is so risky.

[00:18:58.885] 
So increasing the complexity on the base

[00:19:01.725] 
layer of a blockchain makes it harder for an individual to run a full node.

[00:19:06.365] 
And without full nodes,

[00:19:07.885] 
the blockchain relies more on trust and much less on decentralization.

[00:19:12.565] 
Bitcoin's proof of work and small block

[00:19:15.125] 
design keep a lot of power with the individual users.

[00:19:18.445] 
The block size war in 2017 was a real

[00:19:21.285] 
world test of bitcoin's level of decentralization.

[00:19:24.685] 
Ever since the network's early history, there was a growing divide between people

[00:19:28.885] 
who wanted to increase the block size and people who wanted to keep it small.

[00:19:29.10] 
Increasing the block size allows the network to process more transactions.

[00:19:34.00] 
However, increasing the block size also

[00:19:36.11] 
increases the bandwidth and data storage required to run a full node,

[00:19:40.17] 
and in return it puts it out of reach for the everyday user.

[00:19:44.29] 
At one point in 2017, over 80% of minor processing power,

[00:19:49.29] 
the biggest maker of Bitcoin mining equipment, and a large number of major

[00:19:54.11] 
custodians and exchanges, including Coinbase and Grayscale,

[00:19:58.16] 
were in favor of increasing the block size with an upgrade called SegWit Two X.

[00:20:03.28] 
And yet they failed.

[00:20:05.18] 
Why did it fail?

[00:20:06.29] 
Because the plea's were against the idea

[00:20:11.04] 
that's only possible in a network where you have so many people running nodes

[00:20:14.14] 
at home and threatening to do a UASF or something if the change proceeds.

[00:20:18.14] 
And I think realistically that would be a very difficult thing for Ethereum

[00:20:24.08] 
to achieve right now because not many people run the full notes.

[00:20:27.07] 
If Bitcoin were built on a proof of stake

[00:20:29.17] 
model where the more coins you have, the more votes you have on how the network

[00:20:33.18] 
functions, the large exchanges and custodians could have used

[00:20:37.12] 
the millions of coins they held on clients behalf to vote in their own favor.

[00:20:42.18] 
This is similar to how BlackRock maintains

[00:20:45.00] 
the voting rights to trillions of dollars of client assets.

[00:20:48.29] 
Proof of work and a network full of small nodes are the main way to keep

[00:20:53.02] 
a blockchain sufficiently decentralized and secure on the base layer.

[00:20:57.18] 
If Bitcoin ever upgrades to a different

[00:21:00.00] 
system, it would be only with the overwhelming consensus among users.

[00:21:05.17] 
Ethereum has also been running into more scaling problems than Bitcoin,

[00:21:10.04] 
which has opened the door to several centralized and in some ways more

[00:21:14.07] 
efficient competing smart contract blockchains.

[00:21:17.26] 
And among those new proof of state

[00:21:19.20] 
competitors, there are multiple examples of their systems running into problems.

[00:21:24.16] 
One issue involves the Salana blockchain going down for 17 hours.

[00:21:29.10] 
Solana is a popular smart contract

[00:21:31.18] 
blockchain that tries to be more scalable than Ethereum by implementing

[00:21:35.22] 
a combination of proof of stake with proof of history to achieve more transactions.

[00:21:41.10] 
This higher transaction output comes with a few trade offs.

[00:21:45.07] 
First, to run a salon of validator,

[00:21:47.10] 
you need a computer with twelve CPU cores, 128GB of Ram and 300 megabit.

[00:21:53.18] 
A second, upload speed that set up, especially the upload speed part,

[00:21:57.17] 
basically means you need to be a data center operator to run a salona validator.

[00:22:02.29] 
Secondly, even those data center level validators have to rely on archivers if

[00:22:07.29] 
they want to go back through the full history of the blockchain because over

[00:22:11.17] 
time the amount of stored information becomes massive.

[00:22:15.14] 
Thirdly, Salana uses manual slashing.

[00:22:18.14] 
In other words, it's a blockchain that requires human

[00:22:21.11] 
decisions to determine consensus if there are significant attacks on the network.

[00:22:26.16] 
So Salana is not really even an automated blockchain.

[00:22:30.05] 
It's a step back from both proof of work Bitcoin and proof of work Ethereum.

[00:22:34.14] 
In terms of automation in exchange for more throughput and low fees,

[00:22:39.07] 
the consensus mechanism is more manual human and political.

[00:22:43.24] 
Smart contract platforms tend to move towards greater and greater centralization

[00:22:48.10] 
because the more centralized they are, the more efficient they are.

[00:22:51.26] 
And users want efficiency.

[00:22:54.02] 
I've not gone to the step of saying that people should have a theorem,

[00:22:58.00] 
and it's because of that centralization problem that essentially it's this

[00:23:01.23] 
environment where you're changing the engine of a car while you're driving it.

[00:23:06.06] 
So they're going to change from proof of work to proof of stake.

[00:23:09.07] 
It's been delayed for years because it's a hard problem.

[00:23:12.10] 
It's a very hard problem.

[00:23:14.01] 
They keep changing how they're going to scale it.

[00:23:16.11] 
There's been inventions over the past four or five years that have changed some

[00:23:20.26] 
of their base case for how they're going to scale their protocol.

[00:23:24.20] 
And so overall, my issue with some of the smart contract

[00:23:28.08] 
platforms is that they seem like they're going to tend towards centralization.

[00:23:33.16] 
And you see that with the Solano versus Aetherium comparison,

[00:23:36.22] 
where a more centralized blockchain comes along that's more efficient because it's

[00:23:41.24] 
more centralized, and then people start kind of flocking to it.

[00:23:45.07] 
The excitement goes there.

[00:23:47.01] 
The DFI grows a little bit quicker there

[00:23:49.10] 
than on a theorem because there's lower fees.

[00:23:52.24] 
And again, they don't fully understand

[00:23:54.10] 
the trade offs, but as long as it's working, they don't really bind too much.

[00:23:58.00] 
As a result, smart contract platforms that have higher throughput and a massive

[00:24:02.23] 
support each have a decent shot of taking market share.

[00:24:06.07] 
The field keeps diluting itself with more efficient and more centralized networks.

[00:24:11.22] 
However, Aetherium also partially goes

[00:24:14.04] 
down from time to time with unintended chain splits.

[00:24:17.13] 
And it's possible that if it changes over

[00:24:19.16] 
to proof of stake, it could face more severe issues than what Solana faces.

[00:24:24.13] 
So overall, the main theme is that by not including upfront cost as a part of their

[00:24:29.16] 
designs, proof of stake systems inherently rely on more trust and have less ability

[00:24:35.00] 
to recover from chain splits without human intervention.

[00:24:38.19] 
Many people propose proof of stake as

[00:24:40.24] 
superior or better technology than proof of work, and they praise its higher

[00:24:45.10] 
transaction volume systems without realizing these issues.

[00:24:49.00] 
Many of the things they think are bugs to be eliminated from the system,

[00:24:52.20] 
like the fact that a proof of work system has a real world resource cost,

[00:24:56.22] 
are features that make it as secure as possible.

[00:24:59.14] 
To summarize in a sentence, proof of work is inherently moneyLike,

[00:25:04.07] 
while proof of stake is inherently equitylike.

[00:25:07.07] 
What makes proof of stake blockchains

[00:25:09.02] 
inherently equitylike is that they require some form of ongoing governance,

[00:25:13.28] 
whereas proof of work blockchains are more moneyLike.

[00:25:19.18] 
You.
