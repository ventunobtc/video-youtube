14. In the late 1970s, there was an astonishing
breakthrough in the field of cryptography.
I saw this as the critical fork in 
the road for the future of human freedom.
I really did.
In the summer of 77, Mark Miller was
a 20 year old student at Yale working
for a countercultural tech visionary named Ted Nelson.
Like many future cypherpunks, he would learn of
this groundbreaking discovery when the August issue of
Scientific American arrived at his door.
And i'm reading i’m reading Martin Gardner’s
mathematical games column, and i just get
incredibly excited, just incredibly excited.
I call up Ted in the middle of the night, and
I tell Ted, we can prevent the Ministry of Truth.
As Gardner told his readers, a discovery
had been made that would revolutionize the
entire field of secret communication.


15.  It was the work of teams of mathematicians
and computer scientists at MIT and Stanford, including
a young researcher named Whitfield Diffie.
If you look at 1791 at the moment of
the Bill of Rights, impenetrably
private conversations dominated.
What the framers didn’t foresee is that private
communication would happen via computers, sending messages 
across the world that could easily be intercepted.
Public key cryptography gives you a mechanism whereby
you can recover this ability to have an
impenetrably private conversation between two people.
Look at this
a cipher
Well, let’s go back to the
office and get started on it.
Sending a secret message used to involve
translating words through a secret code that
spies and government agents could potentially crack.
Phil, i think i’ve got it. Good.
Z is D, V is E.


16. Anyone sending and receiving messages also had to
have a copy of the secret key or
transation device, just like the decipher rings collected
by american schoolchildren starting in the 1930s.
Here’s how you can get one for your very own.
First, get a jar of chocolate flavored ovaltine
public key cryptography made decoding devices unnecessary, and
figuring out the pattern effectively impossible.
Superman
The big breakthrough was an easy to solve
mathematical formula that you could funnel words into just
as easily as dropping them through a trap door.
But if you flip the problem around and tried
to pull the message out the other side in 
that direction, the formula was almost impossible to solve,
such that even a supercomputer trying random numbers would
need 40 quadrillion years to service the answer.
But the person who set up the mathematical
formula, or trapdoor, held the answer to the 
problem or secret code, making it possible for
that person to retrieve the original message.


17. it could also be compared to the
most ubiquitous trapdoor system for sending messages.
Consider a mailbox.
Anyone can throw a letter in a mailbox, but only
the mailman who has a key can take it out.
Anyone in the word could set up one of
these equations, serving as the mailman of his or
her very own impenetrable virtual letter box
And because that individual could prove ownership of the
mailbox by opening it with the only known key,
public key cryptography also made it possible to set
up a provable identity on the Internet completely disconnected
from any real world personal information.
Knowing economics, what we do, and looking at
what’s happening with the Internet, what can you
see happening way out there in the future?
The most striking non obvious thing is that current
technologies are in the process of giving us a
level of privacy we have never had before.
Essentially, there are now well known ways available in free
software of encrypting messages so that only the intended recipient
can read them, so that if the FBI intercepts them it’s gibberish to them.


18. One way of reading the second amendment is that it
was a way of making sure that if the
government tried to suppress the people, the people would win,
and militia wouldn’t be very good, but if would
outnumber the professionals 100 to one.
In the modern world, the weapons that the army has differed
by a lot more than they did in the 18th century.
But i also think that if you look
at what politics are like nowadays, the real
wars between the government and the population are
information wars, not physical wars.
Encryption means that it can’t arrest you.
They can’t blackmail your key people, can’t do any
of the things government might do to make sure
the public information is what they wanted.
Meanwhile the US Intelligence community was doing everything
in its power to keep this new tool
out of the hands of the public.
Well, somebody once said to me, if you think new
directions had an impact on the outside world, you should
have seen the impact it had at NSA.


19. In part three in this series, we’ll look at the US
Government’s effort to halt the widespread use of
public key cryptography by threatening criminal prosecution and
the legal and public relations battle waged by
one founding member of the cypherpunks for freedom
of speech and software.
PAUSA
A hurricane of unrestrained joy sweeps through
every part of a war sick world.
The breaking of encryption was
essential to the war effort.
England would probably have fallen if they had not been
able to read the enigma messages, because every time the
germans sent bombers, the RAF knew where they were sending
them and could mask the planes there to defend.
If any significant fraction of those attacks had
gotten through, england would have been much more
helpless, may well have fallen, and the course
of world war II may have changed.


20. And that is the origin of the
regulations that said, this is ammunition.
This is an item of war.
And the problem was, they didn’t really
take freedom of speech, freedom of inquiry,
academic freedom into account in that.
But on the matter of encrypted
… terrorists are going to have greater access … 
… these are law enforcement power that are essentially …
… protect wiretapping and authority
me, when i have to save somebody’s life to go in and get vital
information, i think that’s the same choice we have.
Coming up: the story of the US
Government’s long battle to keep strong encryption
out of the hands of its citizens
and how first amendment activists fought back.
Here’s part three in a four part series
on how the cypherpunk movement of the 1990s
anticipated the promise and the peril that lay ahead.
