21. In 1977 researchers at MIT made an astonishing discovery a
mathematical system for encrypting secret messages so
powerful that it had the potential to
make government spying effectively impossible.
But before these mathematicians could publish their research,
the NSA made it clear that doing so
could land them in federal prison.
The US government considered these mathematical
systems modern weapons technologies and distributing
them was a crime.
under the International Traffic and Arm Regulations,
MIT halted plans to distribute the paper.
I decided, quite literally they are going
to classify this over my dead body.
Mark Miller was a 20 years old student at Yale
who had read about this discovery in Scientific American.


22.  So i traveled to MIT, managed to get my
hand on a paper copy of this thing.
I went to a variety of different coffee shops, so
I wasn’t making lots of copies in any one place.
I sent them to home and hobbyist, computer
organizations and magazines all across the country.
And I gave copies of the paper to some
select friends of mine and i told them if
I disappear, make sure this gets out
Early in 1978, the US federal government backed
off and decided to allow publication.
And the world has been on a 
different course ever since it got published.
But the crypto wars were just getting started.
In the late 70s, the National Security Agency
declared the unrestrained public discussion
of cryptographic research threatened our national security.
The private cryptography community and the government have
been sparring over the issue ever since.


23. Marshall McLuhan said that one day we
would all live in a global village.
Well the global village has arrived and 
its main street is called the internet.
The internet also created an electronic surveillance apparatus that
was like nothing the world had ever seen.
Which meant that the cryptography breakthroughs of the
1970s were no longer a rarefied topic.
Thy were privacy, salvation.
Internet users could shield their
online activities from spying.
And that sent the intelligence community
once again scrambling to stop the
dissemination of this powerful tool.
In 1991, a software developer named
Phil Zimmerman released the first relatively
easy-to-use secret messaging system built with
strong encryption, which was called PGP.
Somehow it got overseas.
Now that it’s over there, people are using it and
I’m delighted to hear some good stories about how it’s
used in place where there are oppressive governments.
So the US Justice Department launched a three
year criminal investigation of Zimmerman on the grounds
that by making his software accessible outside the
country, he could be guilty of exporting weapons
under the Arm Control Act.


24. Meanwhile, the National Security Agency argued
that Zimmerman’s software would be used
by child molesters and criminals.
PGP, they’d say, is out there
to protect freedom fighters in Latvia.
Said the NSA’s General Counsel.
But the fact is the only use that has come
to the attention of law enforcement agencies is a guy
who was using PGP so the police could not tell
what little boys he had seduced over the net.
Child pornographers, terrorists, money
launderers, take your pick.
These are the people who will be invoked
as the bringers of death and disruption.
Well, it’s true, it’s true, it’s true.
So they’re right.
Yes, but all technologies have had bad effects.
The telephones allow extortion, death
threats, bomb threats, kidnapping cases.
Uncrontrolled publishing of books could
allow satanic books to appear.
The cypherpunks argued that PGP was like any other published
material, because under the hood, it was just a series
of instructions to be carried out by a machine.


25. Restraint on freedom of expression of software writers
is anathema of free society and a violation
of the First Amendment, wrote the economist and
enterpreneur Phil Salin in a 1991 essay titled
Freedom of Speech and Software.
Encryption can't be controlled whether or not
it's powerful or has impacts on the
government because it's fee speech.
In the early 90s, John Gilmore, who was a 
cofounder of the Cypherpunk movement, risked going to jail
in his campaign to force the government to acknowledge
the regulating encryption violated the First Amendment.
We basically had a community of
a thousand people scattered around.
We were all trying different ideas on how to get
around the government to get encryption to the masses.
What we're afraid of several years from now is
the terrorists both hit their encryption button on the
telephone, and even though we have access, we can't
understand what they're saying on a realtime basis.


26. The Clinton administration told Congress that Americans have
no constitutional right to choose their own method
of encryption and push for legislation that would
require companies to build in a mechanism for
law enforcement agencies to break in.
We're in favor of strong encryption, robust encryption.
We just want to make sure we have a trapdoor
and a key under some judge's authority where we can
get there if somebody is planning a crime.
The cypherpunks look for ways to undercut the government's
case by pointing out the similarities between encryption
software and other forms of protected speech.
Whit Phil Zimmerman under federal investigation for making
his software available for download outside the US.
To prove a point, he convinced MIT press
to mirror his action in the analog world
by printing out the PGP source code, adding
a binding, and shipping it to European bookstores.
The government knew if they went to court to suppress
the publication of a book from a university, that they
would lose, and they would lose in a hurry.
There were people who actually got encryption code
tattooed on their bodies an then started asking,
Can I go to a foreign country?


27. We printed up t-shirts that had encryption
code on them and submitted them to
the government office of Munitions Control.
Can we publish this tshirt?
Ultimately, they never answered that query because they realized
to say no would be to invite a lawsuit they would lose.
And so the best answer was no
answer at all.
Talk a little bit more about encryption technology. No. No.
Thank you.
I hesitate even to make use of the word it,
but I'm not using it anymore. Right.
In 1996, the Justice Department announced that it wouldn't
pursue criminal charges against Phil Zimmerman, and major court
victories came when two federal judges found that encryption
is protected by the First Amendment.
The crypto wars are still ongoing.
What we won in the first round was the right to publish
it and the right to put in mass market software.
But what we didn't actually do is
deploy it in mass market software.
Now there are major companies building serious encryption
into their product, and we're getting a lot
of pushback from the government about this.


28.  We're about the rule of law, but we don't 
want to create spaces that are beyond the reach
of the law in the United States. Right.
It's just the reprehensible behavior of sexual
predation on children, but myriad additional forms of
serious crime enabled by EndtoEnd encryption.
I'm not optimistic that privacy will
prevail in the crypto wars.
It's an ongoing struggle.
In the early 90s, at the same time
that Gilmore was fighting his legal battle for freedom
of speech and software, the cypherpunks were exploring cryptography's
potential in the context of collapsing political borders and
the rise of liberal democracy.
Part four in this series will look
at how those dreams turn on disillusionment
the death of the cypherpunk movement and
it's rebirth following the invention of Bitcoin.

29. You're looking at this going, wow, wouldn't 
it be amazing if this worked?
And then you realize, oh my gosh, it does work.
National borders are just speed
bumps on the information super highway
Cryptography is really, really strong.
We can do whatever we want here.
People might provide the equivalent of what
government does in a decentralized fashion.
I talk about collapse of governments.
I think we actually saw that in the Middle
Ages, probably as a result of the printing press.
This is the story of a community of
scientists, mathematicians, philosophers, and activists who believe that
the Internet, combined with recent breakthroughs in the
field of cryptography, would upend society and usher
in a new era of sovereign individualism.
We have it in our power to begin the
world over again right now and its internal clash
over the optimal path to achieving that goal.
Can evil be done with this technology? Yes.
And so what?
So then?
Deal with it.
Here's the final installment in a four part
series on the origins of the cypherpunk movement
and how it helped shape our modern world.
